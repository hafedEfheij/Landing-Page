### Project 2 - Landing Page (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)

The landing page is part of Front End Developer Nanodegree course. The task is to build a multi section landing page with dynamically built navigation, scroll to top button and 'highlighted' sections - for user to see what section he is actively viewing.
